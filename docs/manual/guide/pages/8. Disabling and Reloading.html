		<h3>Disabling</h3><p class="paragraph"/>You can globally disable all JMS functionality by setting <code>jms.disabled</code> to true in your application config.<p class="paragraph"/>For example you could turn JMS for testing withâ€¦<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>environments &#123;
    test &#123;
        jms.disabled = <span class="java&#45;keyword">true</span>
    &#125;
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>If JMS is disabled then no listeners are registered (so no messages will be received).<p class="paragraph"/>If an attempt is made to send a message while JMS is disabled you will only get a log message alerting you that the message will not be sent because JMS is disabled. This allows you to still use the <code>sendMessage()</code> methods or <code>jmsService</code> even if JMS is disabled.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Reloading</h3><p class="paragraph"/>The JMS plugin has good support for hot reloading during development.<p class="paragraph"/><h4>Listeners</h4><p class="paragraph"/>If you make a change to a service class that is a listener during development, all existing listeners for that service will be shutdown. The service is then re-inspected for listeners that are then registered. This means you can change listener config and have it take effect without restarting your application.<p class="paragraph"/><h4>Config</h4><p class="paragraph"/>If any change to the JMS config is detected, all JMS functionality is torn down and then re-established with the new config. This allows you to change bean definitions (such as container or template options) and have them take effect without restarting your application.<p class="paragraph"/><h4>Disabled/Enabled</h4><p class="paragraph"/>You can also temporarily disable or enable JMS functionality by changing the <code>jms.disabled</code> config option during development and have it take effect without restarting your application.
